## Unit 13 - ETL Case Study Project

The data for the project has been checked and verified.  There are two diagrams and two data folders.  The data in the National folder 
shows information based on National Studies and cannot be broken down by state but can be broken down by other categories - that are shown in the datasets.
The data in the States folder shows datasets broken down by state.  The date ranges are from 2016 to 2019, for most of the data.  But the State Certification 
study only shows data for 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 - treat these two data ranges are 2016 and 2017.  The state certification is relevant because it is the only 
check for how states report their certification counts.  You can look at the references if you are interested in how numbers are now reported for the lunch program.
